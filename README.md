## About the project

This website was made for the "Members Only" challenge on TheOdinProject.com.

This project is meant to showcase the NodeJS skills learned so far, mainly the authentication and database management skills.

I didn't focus too much on the interface, but the priority in this project was to exercise all the back-end concepts learned.

You can test the demo [here.](https://jgoldenusr.github.io/11.Shopping-cart/)
